You can use ant, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or pretty much any IDE
to compile this library app. Before building, you should ensure that:

Read the how to build guide https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Build+The+Android+App -- This mainly for eclipse based setup. 
But it should be easily adaptable to other setup. 

To use ant to build the project,

1) You've added the necessary JARs in `Core/libs' directory to your build path.

2) Your project targets API level 7 or higher.

3) Create a local.properties file and insert the absolute path where you have 
your sdk stored. Eg. sdk.dir=/home/username/android-sdk-linux_x86

4) Type "ant debug"
